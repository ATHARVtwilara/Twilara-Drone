# FlySky FS-i6 Based Camera Quadcopter

This repository documents the design and build of a quadcopter intended for
stable flight and basic camera payload operation within a limited budget
(approximately ₹20,000).

The objective of this project is to understand the complete drone system
including mechanical structure, electronics, firmware configuration,
wiring, and flight testing.

This is an educational project and not a commercial product.

## Project Objectives
- Build a stable quadcopter using commonly available components
- Integrate GPS-assisted flight modes
- Support a lightweight camera payload
- Use open-source flight control firmware
- Maintain clear documentation of the complete build process

## System Overview
- Frame: F450 class quadcopter frame
- Flight Controller: Pixhawk 2.4.8
- Firmware: ArduPilot (ArduCopter)
- Radio System: FlySky FS-i6 with iA6B receiver
- Power System: 3S LiPo battery
- Camera: Lightweight action camera or FPV camera
