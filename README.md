# FlySky FS-i6 Based Camera Quadcopter

This repository documents the design and build of a quadcopter intended for stable flight and basic camera payload operation within a limited budget (approximately ₹12,400).

The objective of this project is to understand the complete drone system including mechanical structure, electronics, firmware configuration, wiring, and flight testing.

This is an educational project and not a commercial product.

Project Objectives
- Build a stable quadcopter using commonly available components
- Integrate GPS-assisted flight modes
- Support a lightweight camera payload
- Use open-source flight control firmware
- Maintain clear documentation of the complete build process

System Overview
- Frame: F450 class quadcopter frame with integrated PCB wiring
- Flight Controller: Omnibus F4 V2 PRO with built-in OSD
- Firmware: ArduPilot (ArduCopter)
- Radio System: FlySky FS-i6 transmitter with FS-iA6 receiver
- Power System: 11.1V (3S) 2200mAh LiPo battery
